# Amiiboproject

Amiiboproject uses the HTTParty gem to request data from the Amiibo API. The Colorize gem is used for some light coloring throughout the CLI to emphasis highlighing and directions. You will get the Amiibo names, secondary character names (alternate way of identifying them), what game series they came from, what Amiibo series they came from and lastly what type of Amiibo they are (i.e. Figure, Card, etc...). There is several options to search and display Amiibos by certain keys from the Amiibo API.
